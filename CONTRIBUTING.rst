Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EzFlow could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official EzFlow docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/neu-vig/ezflow/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `ezflow` for local development.

1. Fork the `ezflow` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/ezflow.git

3. Create a Conda virtual environment using the `environment.yml` file. Install your local copy of the package into the environment::

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate ezflow
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Set up pre-commit hooks::

    $ pip install pre-commit
    $ pre-commit install

5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Ensure you write tests for the code you add and run the tests before you commit. You can run tests locally using `pytest` from the root directory of the repository::

    $ pytest

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    Note: You might need to add and commit twice if pre-commit hooks modify your code.

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, appropriate doctrings should be added.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ pytest tests.test_ezflow


Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
